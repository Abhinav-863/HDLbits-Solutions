# Problem Statement

Build a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0

Now that you've worked through the previous problem, let's see if you can do a simple problem without the hints.

>HDLBits uses Verilog-2001 ANSI-style port declaration syntax because it's easier to read and reduces typos. You may use the older Verilog-1995 syntax if you wish. For example, the two module declarations below are acceptable and equivalent:
> ```
>module top_module ( zero );
>    output zero;
>    // Verilog-1995
>endmodule
> ```
> ```
>module top_module ( output zero ); 
>   // Verilog-2001
>endmodule
> ```

**Expected solution length**: Around 1 line.
