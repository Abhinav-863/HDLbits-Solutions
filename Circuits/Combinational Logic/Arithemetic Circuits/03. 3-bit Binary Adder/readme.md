# Problem Statement

Now that you know how to build a [full adder](<../02. Full Adder/readme.md>), make 3 instances of it to create a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder. The adder adds two 3-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 3-bit sum and carry out. To encourage you to actually instantiate full adders, also output the carry-out from each full adder in the ripple-carry adder. cout[2] is the final carry-out from the last full adder, and is the carry-out you usually see.
