## About HDL Bits 🧠
**HDL Bits** is a website containing a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The exercises range from tutorial-style problems for beginners to increasingly challenging tasks that test and improve your circuit design skills. Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.

### How to use HDLBits ▶️
1. Use any browser and go to [HDLBits site](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page).
2. Choose a problem: [Browse the problem set](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets) or go to the [first problem](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Step_one).
3. Write a solution in Verilog.
4. Submit, simulate, and debug if necessary

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 🛠️
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Verilog/SystemVerilog compiler (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- A simulator (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository 🔄
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hdl-bits-solutions.git
cd hdl-bits-solutions
```

## Usage 📘
### How to Find Solutions 🔍
Navigate to the `challenges` directory to find solutions to specific HDL Bits exercises. Each challenge directory contains:
- `problem_statement.md`: The original problem statement.
- `solution_verilog.v`: Solution written in Verilog.
- `testbench.sv`: Testbench to verify the solution.
