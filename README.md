## About HDL Bits 🧠
**HDL Bits** is a website containing a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The exercises range from tutorial-style problems for beginners to increasingly challenging tasks that test and improve your circuit design skills.

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 🛠️
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Verilog/SystemVerilog compiler (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- A simulator (e.g., Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, ModelSim)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository 🔄
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hdl-bits-solutions.git
cd hdl-bits-solutions
```

## Usage 📘
### How to Find Solutions 🔍
Navigate to the `challenges` directory to find solutions to specific HDL Bits exercises. Each challenge directory contains:
- `problem_statement.md`: The original problem statement.
- `solution_verilog.v`: Solution written in Verilog.
- `testbench.sv`: Testbench to verify the solution.

### How to Run Solutions ▶️
Use the provided scripts to compile and run the solutions:
```bash
cd challenges/challenge_01
../../scripts/compile_design.sh solution_verilog.v
../../scripts/run_simulation.sh testbench.sv
```
